# Projectile Motion Simulation (Euler’s Method)  
This project demonstrates projectile motion using semi-implicit Euler’s integration method in Python.
It simulates the motion of a particle under gravity, plots its trajectory, and even animates the motion for better visualization.

## Features
- Simulates 2D projectile motion using physics principles.  
- Implements Semi-Implicit Euler Method for numerical integration.  
- Visualizes the trajectory with Matplotlib plots.  
- Generates smooth animations of the motion.  
- Encapsulates motion logic in a reusable Particle class.  

## How it Works!  
- Define initial position, velocity, and acceleration for the particle.
- Update particle state using Euler’s method at each time step dt.
- Store trajectory points in arrays.
- Visualize results:
-- Static trajectory plots.
-- Animated simulation using FuncAnimation.
